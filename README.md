> **This fork: title-aware paragraph vectors for the retrieval stage** (Ariel Halevy, home assignment, October 2026).
> Branch `title-context-embedding`, [PR #1 of this fork](https://github.com/arielhalevy123/Webiks-Hebrew-RAGbot-Demo/pull/1). Upstream: [NNLP-IL/Webiks-Hebrew-RAGbot-Demo](https://github.com/NNLP-IL/Webiks-Hebrew-RAGbot-Demo).

> | **What changed** | Each paragraph's stored vector now carries its page title: the title is prepended to the embedded text and a separately embedded title vector is fused in at weight 0.3. Two opt-in keys in [`app/src/doc-config.json`](app/src/doc-config.json); remove them and the system is the original. Query path, index layout, API and frontend unchanged. Engine side: [arielhalevy123/Webiks-Hebrew-RAGbot PR #1](https://github.com/arielhalevy123/Webiks-Hebrew-RAGbot/pull/1). |
> | **Result** | 296 held-out questions, full corpus: hit@1 0.368 → **0.527**, hit@3 0.581 → **0.709**, MRR@10 0.496 → **0.636**; 138 questions improved, 35 worse. Same direction on all 2,951 questions (hit@1 0.412 → 0.529). |
> | **Read first** | [`SUBMISSION.md`](SUBMISSION.md) (2 pages: what, why, metrics, results, how to run) · [`APPENDIX.md`](APPENDIX.md) (full experiment record, error analysis, rejected alternatives) |
> | **Reproduce** | [`retrieval_eval/README.md`](retrieval_eval/README.md) — the harness scores a variant in ~3 s on cached vectors and matches Webiks' own evaluator to 4 decimals. Every number comes from a JSON in [`results/`](results/). |

> | **Screenshots** | [`docs/screenshots/`](docs/screenshots/) — the live Demo answering with the new vectors, the evaluation run, the test suites |
> | **Run it** | §5 of `SUBMISSION.md`. Short version: Python 3.10–3.12, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, Elasticsearch 8.12.2 in Docker, model in `app/artifacts/`, corpus in `data/`, then `python retrieval_eval/fast_index.py --corpus data/paragraph_corpus.json` (same documents as `/initialize_elastic_from_json`, minutes instead of hours) and `cd app/src && python -m uvicorn main:app --port 5050`. |
> | **Known upstream quirks** | `uvicorn app.src.main:app` does not resolve; start from `app/src`. Port 5000 is AirPlay on macOS. The openai client refuses an empty key even with `IS_MOCK_GPT_CLIENT=true`; any non-empty string works. 6 tests in `tests/test_main.py` error on upstream and here alike (the test patches `builtins.open` during import). |

The original README follows.

## Overview

This project is a FastAPI-based application that integrates with Elasticsearch and a rag-bot to perform various document-related operations.
It includes endpoints for searching, updating, and rating documents, as well as handling configurations and updates.
this projects integrates with [Webiks-Hebrew-RAGbot](https://github.com/NNLP-IL/Webiks-Hebrew-RAGbot) project.
You need to have a retrival model. You can get it from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i_7bTdGWC7yUVC_NLDQGk63kPRhZT7y3/view).
You can train model by yourself. You can see the train code [here](https://github.com/NNLP-IL/Webiks-Hebrew-RAGbot-Trainer).

## Setup

1. Setup the Elasticsearch DB on the cloud or on your local Docker and place your credentials in the .env file
2. Add the index name of the docs in the .env file.
3. Seed the database with docs using the /initialize_elastic_from_json route.
4. Seed your first configurations for the model using the /set_config route. See /set_config’s documentation below.

## Flow of Project

![kolzchut-chart drawio](./kolzchut-chart.drawio.png)

1. The user submits a question using the /search route.
2. The question is forwarded to the ragbot.
3. Ragbot returns paragraphs and chains them to llm_client.
4. llm_client generates responses from Llm and sends them back to the user, along with the paragraphs and associated metadata.
5. The app stores the answer in the database, along with the question, the docs and some additional details. See /search route’s documentation below.
6. If the user rates the answer, this rating is sent to the app, which then stores it linked to the specific answer. See the /rating route’s documentation below.

## Project Structure

- **app/src/**: Main application files.
- **app/.env**: Environment variables for the project. You can find an example file included in the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. move to the project directory: `cd Webiks-Hebrew-RAGbot-Demo`
3. Ensure you have python 3.10 installed (and not a higher version).
4. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv`
5. move to the virtual environment: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
6. Create a .env file in app/ directory.
7. Create a new directory in app/ named "artifacts".
8. Add the [retrival model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i_7bTdGWC7yUVC_NLDQGk63kPRhZT7y3/view) to the new artifacts directory.
9. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
10. Create a docker container for Elasticsearch using the command (change the %%path_to_project%% to your path).
```
docker run -e "discovery.type=single-node" -e "xpack.security.enabled=false" -e "ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms2g -Xmx2g" -p 9200:9200 -v %%path_to_project%%/app/data/elastic/data:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data elasticsearch:8.12.2
```
11. Add the paragraphs corpus to the base directory. You can find it [here](https://github.com/NNLP-IL/Webiks-Hebrew-RAGbot-KolZchut-Paragraph-Corpus).
12. Run the project and seed the db using the /initialize_elastic_from_json route.
    note: the seeding process takes time ao the first answers will be not accurate. We recommend you to use GPU.

## Running

```
uvicorn app.src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000

Returns a 200 status code if the service is running.

### Get Configuration

`GET /get_config`
Search for the last configuration in the db. Returns the current configuration.

### Set Configuration

`POST /set_config`

Updates the configuration with the provided parameters. If some of the parameters don't exist - it sets them as the
previous config.

### Search

`POST /search`
**Body:**
`{ "query": "string", "asked_from": "string (url)" }`
Performs a search query and returns the results.

### Initialize Elastic from JSON

`GET /initialize_elastic_from_json`
Initializing the data from the corpus to the elastic. Recommended to execute before first search run.

`POST /operate_docs`
**Body:** `{
  "operation": str("create" or "update" only),
  "documents": [
    { "doc_id": number, "title": "string", "link": "string", "content": "string" }
  ]
}
`.
Handles document operations by creating or updating documents.

### Delete Document

`DELETE /delete_doc?doc_id={number}&obj_id={number}`
**Query:** doc_id: Document ID to delete.
obj_id: The index of the document to delete.
Deletes document using the provided document's parameters

### Get Doc

`GET /get_doc?doc_id={number}`
**Query:** doc_id: The document ID you want to retrieve.
